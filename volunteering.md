FOL is run entirely by volunteers!  We need your help to make all our activities a success.

Volunteers are needed to:
* **Sort donations** – as books are received, they need to be inventoried, priced, and organized. Weekly sorting hours are Tuesdays 2-7pm, Wednesdays 9am-12pm, Thursdays 9am-12pm, and Saturdays 9am-3pm.
* **Assist at book sales** – assist customers and carry out books

All sorting volunteers must be active FOL members.

High school or college students who want community service hours for assisting at book sales should contact Carl Brown at ____.
